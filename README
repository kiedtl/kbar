Kied Llaentenn's Lemonbar
=========================

Created to replace a Polybar configuration. Polybar is nice, but it takes up a significant amount of CPU on a Raspberry Pi Zero. Previously, I piped Polybar into Lemonbar like so:

	polybar -s -c ~/.config/polybar/config | lemonbar 

But eventually I wrote this script, trying to save valuable CPU time. Only afterwards did I do some benchmarks and discover that Polybar was, after all, faster. -_-

Usage
-----
Just run the script, and pipe it into lemonbar. Here's my setup:
	. ~/.cache/wal/colors.sh && ./kbar | lemonbar \
		-g 1896x24+12+1048 \
		-f "Siji:size=9" -f "xos Terminus:size=9" \
		-n bar \
		-pdb  -u 3 \
		-B $color0 -F $color7 # accent color: $color6

Note that this script requires the Terminus font and the Siji icons, so ensure that you have that installed before running this.

Feel free to steal this script, but please keep the heading.
